BufExplorer Plugin for Vim


Contributing
============

I want this to be a plugin nobody objects to installing. Let me know if you have any objections to anything. There are a handful of settings I figured might be controversial, but I included anyways, just to settle the question once and for all. It won't take much persuasion for me to remove them. Everything else is negotiable.

Feel free to ask a question if you're not sure why I've set something, as I haven't put much effort into documenting that.

I'm a stickler for commit messages, so if you send me a pull request with so much as a superfluous period in the subject line, I will close it without so much as a second thought, and save my precious attention for someone who can actually follow directions.
